# üè´ Course Methodology

## Class Organisation

Each cohort will be self-driven with the help of all the material in this curriculum. Office hours will be held twice a week, in which you will be given opportunity to ask about or clarify specific material related to that specific day's, or weeks, material.\
\
Important to note that these are not open lectures, so section leaders will not come and hold re-caps of all the material, but they are there to guide you if needed.

The pages below will give you more detail overview over the different parts that may help you through your SWE Fundamental Lite journey with us, we wish you all the best!
