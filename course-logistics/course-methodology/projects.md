# ðŸŽ² Course Projects

## Project submission

Projects are a crucial part to show your understanding of the material, and through out the course there will be two projects for you to complete

1. [Scissor, paper, stone](../../projects/project-1-scissors-paper-stone/)
2. [Beat That](../../projects/project-2-beat-that.md)

In order to be counted as having completed the course, both projects will have to be submitted onto Github following the instructions found [here.](broken-reference)

### Submitting Projects

After uploading your projects into GitHub, if you wish to receive a certificate from Rocket Academy to acknowledge completion of the course, please fill out a [form here](https://forms.gle/oTQAiX6D1ShcYKLn6) to allow us to review your code.

After reviewing and confirming your completion of the project, we will email you a copy of your well deserved certificate.
