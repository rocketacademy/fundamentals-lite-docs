### Telegram

Once you sign up for the course, we will invite you into a telegram channel just for your batch. In this channel we will send out reminders on the course progress, and send reminders for when office hours will run.

### Office Hours

Office hours is a great opportunity for you to come in and interact with our section leaders. Besides asking question with regards to the learning material, if time permits, you can also ask about their software engineering journeys too! Many of Rocket's section leaders have themselves too transitioned from past careers into software engineering, and have once sat where you are now at!

However the main purpose of these are to ask questions, and there are more _efficient_ ways for one to ask questions which we would like to share with you.

### Provide Context for Questions

To get help effectively, we need to provide context. One of the biggest differences between junior and senior engineers is the amount of relevant context they provide with their questions.

Questions **without context** usually sound like: "_It doesn't work. Could you help?_" A question with **relevant** context might be more like: "_Program A is giving me Error X. I didn't expect X to happen because of Logic B. When I googled X, it told me that this might be related to Y, but I don't see Y anywhere in the system._"

Contextual questions help the answerer by filling in the details needed to fully understand the question. In the field of programming (not just for students) it is well known that simply formulating the question often leads directly to the answer. [This is called rubber-duck programming.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber\_duck\_debugging)

#### How to ask contextual questions

Try to answer the following when asking questions. What is the problem? Include any relevant error messages in text or screenshots. What is your hypothesis? What have you tried? Include any relevant output or Google results. This will not only assist the person helping you, it will actually make you a better coder.
