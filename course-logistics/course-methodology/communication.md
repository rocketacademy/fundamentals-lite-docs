## Telegram

Before the batch starts, we will invite you into a Telegram channel just for your batch. In this channel we will send out reminders on course progress and office hours.

## Office Hours

Office hours are a great opportunity to meet Rocket's section leaders. Besides asking questions on the learning material, if time permits, you can also ask about their software engineering journeys! Many of Rocket's section leaders are also career switchers to software engineering, and have once sat where you are now at!

### Pro Tip: Provide Context for Questions

To get help effectively, we need to provide context. One of the biggest differences between junior and senior engineers is the amount of relevant context they provide with their questions.

Questions **without context** usually sound like: "_It doesn't work. Could you help?_" A question with **relevant** context might be more like: "_Program A is giving me Error X. I didn't expect X to happen because of Logic B. When I googled X, it told me that this might be related to Y, but I don't see Y anywhere in the system._"

Contextual questions help the answerer by filling in the details needed to fully understand the question. In the field of programming (not just for students) it is well known that simply formulating the question often leads directly to the answer. [This is called rubber-duck programming.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber\_duck\_debugging)

Try to answer the following when asking questions. What is the problem? Include any relevant error messages in text or screenshots. What is your hypothesis? What have you tried? Include any relevant output or Google results. This will not only assist the person helping you, it will actually make you a better coder.
